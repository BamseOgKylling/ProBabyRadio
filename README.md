Discord Bot with Radio options for me and my friends while we sit and do whatever we do .
API comes form Discord Dev portal.
Using render for keeping it online (when its online) / works fine if you keep it on locally on you computer aswell aslong as your computer is on and the project is on.

Will add more steps later on what settings my discord api have.
Working on adding youtube links to play for the discord. ( will take prio then when link is done playing jump back to radio if radio was on before posting !play (youtubelink)).

Fun little project i just started on when i saw a need for it during late gaming nights or just from keeping discord channel from being to quiet. Some friends use it while they re studying.
